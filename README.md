/ > few days ago, having drinks with a few friends go to a small hotel.
I just in the beginning, in came a young monk, wears a gray robes, beads hung on the item.
His hands folded, a deep bow bow to me, reciting, Mr Yin tang shine, physiognomy of charity, and Buddha decree by destiny, I observed Mr Long.
Then handed a slightly smaller than the card "talisman" metal, glittering.
At that time, zhu is my hands with a piece of dog meat, to eat.
Right hand down the chopsticks, the left hand took the amulet.
Monk said the talisman is a holy man medallion, free to you, insurable you everything goes well, peace life.
South avalokitesvara as are printed on the operator, and "prajnaparamita heart sutra".
Since with the Buddha's decree by destiny, must be to Buddha said about his sincerity.
Then donate a few yuan of money raised, monks quit.
A few friends smiled and raised his glass, all of you have only the Buddha, and congratulations, to have a job!
A few drinks, then think of harshness, a big dog but I a not move.
Remember that have a get-together with chinese-american Mr D, was a plate of dog meat, we let him have a taste, but he shook his head, had some green vegetables to eat with chopsticks.
Asked him why, he just said, casually, some things, although I don't mind, but I'm a lousy.
Then, I just feel so humble and small.
One night, walking alone in the north of the lake.
Large areas are cold and clean water, like in front of a huge mirror, reflected the shore lights and shadows, and everything it touches.
Healing at the beginning of the cold wind, blowing the Buddha on the cheek, to feel a little bit worried, afraid of relapse.
Why is ill?
Why even the doctors couldn't find the cause of the disease?
With the amulet, why let me had a baffling disease?
Is written in the amulet "life and peace, and prosperity" is lying?
No, no, I am convinced, must be to forget the Buddha in my mind.
To me, for everyone is fair.
With a talisman, is still palpable, this is I deserve punishment.
What time the moon in the sky, the stars, make the water scale scale, I just walk quietly in the water's edge.
The moon in the sky, but like the monk's smiling face, before my eyes.
What is the Buddha?
Perhaps, the Buddha's net.
And what is Buddha edge?
Buddha edge must be close to the edge of the net.
Such understanding must be biased, but I prefer to believe your own understanding.
I'll never forget that witnessed the scene.
He lifted the axe, grabbing at the neck with a rope tied to the dogs, the axe on the dog's head violently hit.
Dog up looked at him in despair, and in desperation dodge, once, twice, three times...
But eventually escape not to drop of your own destiny, it is hit, suddenly fell on the ground, the body twitching.
And he quickly picked up a sharp knife, might go toward the dog's neck and he is going to peel the skin...
Beside him on the shelf, already hanging several is to skin the dog's body, the underground is a bloody...
And the dogs in iron cages, watching everything in sight, a cry of rage and fear...
I am walking on the street, the in the mind cursing, eyes blurred my eyes water, but I never looked back.
That moment, I saw a little girl and her mother cried in horror, the mother back over, the little girl turned their faces to.
Perhaps many years later, the girl will still be awakened by a nightmare.
That is a kind of what kind of scared?
Many times, I was walking around the streets, afraid to go through that scene...
Tragedies like this happen every day, I know - in the streets of the crowd gathered.
Often in the dream raised his ax, hit to the restaurant owner.
Know how Nietzsche is mad?
That was in Nietzsche's later life, no one understanding and recognition to pour into the lives and creation of his works and thoughts, friend also left him one by one, have a like-minded people, he became one of the world's most solitary poison sting, he felt very lonely and lonely.
He was alone, walking in the streets of cold and cheerless.
When a driver with a group of horses from his passing, groom mercilessly with a whip to whipping up a musty old horse.
At this moment, Nietzsche's eyes well up with tears, he ran to the herd, holding that a beaten horse, crying: "my poor brother ah, why are you such a suffering!"
Thus, Nietzsche got mad crazy, he did not wake up.
When I think about the details, I always can't restrain oneself, will be filled with tears.
Nietzsche said: "god is dead!"
God is not dead?
How many people are there in this world really believe in god?
If god watching all the world, don't be angry just strange!
"Clock statement eye, moonlight according to zen".
Must have some bell, it to his holy land, the distance here has been very ethereal, I couldn't hear.
The moonlight is just around the corner, it will let me much a few minutes of zen?
Let me use the zen to comprehend the ethereal bell?
"The evil mo, the adherence to the" good, how many people the root growth, away from evil, and try to make human pure land?
Nietzsche is not, I am still at the edge of the net, I have what reason, let people in net?
I have much ability to make the world become clean?
Side is water purification, one side is the dust, I walk on the edge of the water, but I will still go on the dust.
Should thank the young monk, should thank Mr D.
Is that they let me withdraw of chopsticks, put down the piece of "delicious".
But I will be on the brink of that, in a not since the dial the pain.
I don't like Nietzsche to go crazy, I also cannot achieve the saint.
Everyone said that money is a thing apart, living not bring, naked, and everyone are beyond the dial to the mud ze swimming in money.
And it is with our flesh?
We use animal flesh to populate our body, let the blood flow into our blood vessels of animals, with fur keep out our ugly, whitewash our soul!
We can put our money and our flesh into the next reincarnation of life.
I believe that life is no reincarnation, but I believe that man is a soul, the soul is eternal life, no matter the soul is clean, or dirty, is beautiful, or ugly, soul will exist forever, until the end of the universe.
I don't know whether my body has already and my soul, I was so emotional...
This let a person think of is very afraid.
And I, will be doomed to walk in the beauty and ugliness, between clean and dirty, walking on the edge of this.
One hundred and eighty-one, a little sincerity is better than two hundred gold, a text message to my all heart.
A scent of reed leaves, of a sweet dumplings, in the true information, send to you: happy Dragon Boat Festival
